If the phone says "Untrusted Developer":
  Settings > General > VPN & Device Management > your Apple ID > Trust, then open Guidy.
If it asks to find devices on your local network: Allow (needed to reach the Mac backend).
With a free Apple ID the app stops opening after 7 days -- just run this again.
