/// Crowdsourced live-vehicle tracking, rider side.

/// Guidy has no dedicated vehicle-tracking hardware or driver-side app --
/// the only source of real-time position for "is my bus actually close"
/// is riders' own phones, reported while they're actively riding a leg
/// the app told them to board. This service is the thin client half of
/// that: it knows which transit leg (route_id/direction_id) the rider is
/// currently on, throttles and forwards GPS fixes to the backend, and
/// closes out the session when the rider stops riding that leg.
///
/// It deliberately does NOT own a location stream itself -- MapScreen
/// already runs a Geolocator position stream for the "distance to next
/// stop" feature, and this piggybacks on those same fixes via
/// [onPositionUpdate] rather than opening a second GPS subscription
/// (unnecessary battery cost, and two independent streams would just
/// report near-duplicate fixes anyway).
///
/// See raptor_engine.py's _find_equivalent_routes() and live_tracking.py
/// on the backend for what these reports power: a real-time ETA
/// attached to every route that could substitute for the one the rider
/// was routed onto, instead of the app committing to a single
/// potentially-wrong GTFS timetable number.
